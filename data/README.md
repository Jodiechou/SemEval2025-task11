## Dataset Information

Our collection includes datasets in multiple languages designed for research on text-based emotion detection and related tasks. They contain text instances along with their annotations for various emotions. 

### Track 1 (Emotion Classification)

For track 1, each entry in a given dataset consists of a unique identifier, a text sample, and seven columns representing different emotions: Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Neutral, and Surprise. Each emotion column is binary, where 0 indicates the absence of the emotion and 1 indicates its presence. Note that a single text can express multiple emotions simultaneously. The columns are named as follows:

- **id**: the unique identifier of a given instance.
- **text**: the annotated textual instance.
- **Joy**: binary labeled. 0 indicates the absence of joy in the text, and 1 indicates its presence.
- **Fear**: binary labeled. 0 indicates the absence of fear in the text, and 1 indicates its presence.
- **Anger**: binary labeled. 0 indicates the absence of anger in the text, and 1 indicates its presence.
- **Sadness**: binary labeled. 0 indicates the absence of sadness in the text, and 1 indicates its presence.
- **Disgust**: binary labeled. 0 indicates the absence of disgust in the text, and 1 indicates its presence.
- **Neutral**: binary labeled. 1 indicates that the text in neutral and  and 0 indicates that it is not.
- **Surprise**: binary labeled. 0 indicates the absence of surpise in the text, and 1 indicates its presence.

### Track 2 (Ordinal Intensity)

For track 2, each entry in a given dataset includes a unique identifier, a text, the dominant emotion expressed in the text, and an intensity class representing the strength of the emotion on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating the absence of emotion and 3 indicating the highest level of intensity. Such as:


- **id**: the unique identifier of a given instance.
- **text**: the annotated textual instance.
- **emotion**: the primary emotion expressed in the text.
- **intensity_class**: the intensity level of the emotion (0:no emotion, 1: low emotion, 2: medium emotion, and 3: high intensity).
