## Dataset Information

Our dataset collection includes datasets in multiple languages. The datasets are designed for research on text-based emotion detection and related tasks, and contain text instances along with their annotations for various emotions. 

### Track 1 (Emotion Classification)

For the track 1 datasets, each entry in the dataset consists of a unique identifier, a text sample in Hausa, and seven columns representing different emotions: Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Neutral, and Surprise. Each emotion column is binary, where `0` indicates the absence of the emotion and `1` indicates its presence. Note: A single text sample can express multiple emotions simultaneously. 

Here are the components of the dataset:

- **id**: A unique identifier for each text.
- **text**: The actual text in the Hausa language.
- **Joy**: Indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of joy in the text.
- **Fear**: Indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of fear in the text.
- **Anger**: Indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of anger in the text.
- **Sadness**: Indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of sadness in the text.
- **Disgust**: Indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of disgust in the text.
- **Neutral**: Indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of a neutral tone in the text.
- **Surprise**: Indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of surprise in the text.

### Track 2 (Ordinal Intensity)

For the track 2 datasets, each entry includes a unique identifier, a text, the dominant emotion expressed in the text, and an intensity class indicating the strength of the emotion on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 being no-emotion and 3 being the highest.

Here are the components of the dataset:

- **id**: A unique identifier for each text.
- **text**: The actual text in one of the language.
- **emotion**: The primary emotion expressed in the text.
- **intensity_class**: The intensity level of the emotion, ranging from 0 (no emotion) to 3 (high intensity).
