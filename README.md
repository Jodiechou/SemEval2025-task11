# SemEval-2025 Task 12 : Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection

## Overview

Emotion detection is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that various applications such as building dialogue systems, opinion mining, and mental health analysis benefit from. However, most work on emotion detection has focused on high-resource languages. This shared task aims to reduce this gap by introducing new manually annotated emotion datasets for more than 30 predominantly low-resource languages from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, along with a few high-resource languages.


## Languages

The shared task includes the following languages:

- **Africa**: Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, Hausa, Igbo, Kinyarwanda, Moroccan Arabic, Mozambican Portuguese, Nigerian-Pidgin, Oromo, Setswana, Somali, Swahili, Tigrinya, Twi, Xitsonga, isiXhosa, Yoruba, isiZulu
- **Asia**: Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Javanese, Marathi
- **Europe & North America**: English, German, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Tatar, Ukrainian
- **Latin America**: Brazilian Portuguese


## Tracks

Participants can participate in one or more of the following tracks:


### Track A: Multi-label Emotion Detection


Given a set of labeled training data in a target language, predict one or more emotions that the speaker is likely feeling in the text from the following emotion classes and neutral: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, or Neutral.

### Track B: Emotion Intensity (ordinal)

Given a set of labeled training data in a target language annotated with emotion, classify the text into one of four ordinal classes of intensity that best represents the emotional state of the writer:
1. No emotion
2. A low amount of emotion
3. A moderate amount of emotion
4. A high amount of emotion

### Track C: Cross-lingual Emotion Detection

Given training and validation data in English, predict the emotion of a new text instance in a different target language from the set of six emotion classes: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, or classified as Neutral.


## Dataset Structure

The dataset structure will vary depending on the track:

- **Track 1**: [Example Text, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral]
- **Track 2**: [Example Text, 0,1,2,4]
- **Track 3**: [Example Text, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral]

We provide pilot dataset in the following folders: Track A, Track B, Track C

## Evaluation

The performance of each submission will be evaluated using F1-score based on the predicted labels and the gold ones. Participants will be provided with an evaluation script and a starter kit that includes a simple baseline.
