# Emotion Recognition in Text

Emotions are simultaneously familiar and mysterious. On the one hand, we all express and manage our emotions every day. Yet, on the other hand, emotions are complex, nuanced, and sometimes hard to articulate. We also use language in subtle and complex ways to express emotion. Further, people are highly variable in how they perceive and express emotions (even within the same culture or social group). Thus, we can never truly identify how one is feeling based on something that they have said with absolute certainty. 

Emotion recognition is not one task but an umbrella term for several tasks such as detecting the emotions of the speaker, identifying what emotion a piece of text is conveying and detecting emotions evoked in a reader. 


This task is on **perceived emotion** and focuses on:

- **Determining what emotion most people will think the speaker may be feeling given a sentence or short text snippet uttered by the speaker.**

The task is **not** about:

- The emotion evoked in the reader.
- The emotion of someone else mentioned in the text.
- Or **even** the true emotion of the speaker (which cannot be definitively known from just a short text snippet).

We acknowledge the importance of this distinction as perceived emotions can differ from actual emotions due to various factors such as cultural context, individual differences in emotional expression, and the limitations of text-based communication.


## Languages

The shared task includes the following languages:

- [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans), [Algerian Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_Arabic), [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic), [Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_language), [Igbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_language), [Kinyarwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinyarwanda), [Moroccan Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Arabic), [Mozambican Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambican_Portuguese), [Nigerian-Pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Pidgin), [Oromo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oromo_language), [Setswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tswana_language), [Somali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_language), [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language), [Tigrinya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigrinya_language),[Xitsonga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsonga_language), [isiXhosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_language), [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), [isiZulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language) [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic), [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language), [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi), [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language), [Javanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language), [Marathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language) [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language), [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language), [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language), [Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatar_language), [Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language), [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language) [Brazilian Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Portuguese)




## Tracks

Participants can participate in one or more of the following tracks:


- **Track A: Multi-label Emotion Detection**: Given a set of labeled training data in a target language, predict one or more emotions that the speaker is likely feeling in the text from the following emotion classes and neutral: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, or Neutral.

- **Track B: Emotion Intensity (ordinal)**: Given a set of labeled training data in a target language annotated with emotion, classify the text into one of four ordinal classes of intensity that best represents the emotional state of the writer:
(1) No emotion, (2),  A low amount of emotion (3) A moderate amount of emotion (4) A high amount of emotion

- **Track C: Cross-lingual Emotion Detection**: Given training and validation data in English, predict the emotion of a new text instance in a different target language from the set of six emotion classes: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, or classified as Neutral.


## Dataset Structure

The dataset structure will vary depending on the track:

- **Track 1**: [Example Text, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral]
- **Track 2**: [Example Text, 0,1,2,4]
- **Track 3**: [Example Text, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral]

For each track, we provide the sample dataset, training dataset, and evaluation dataset in the following folders: [Track A](#), [Track B](#), [Track](#)

## Evaluation

The performance of each submission will be evaluated using F1-score based on the predicted labels and the gold ones. Participants will be provided with an evaluation script and a starter kit that includes a simple baseline.
